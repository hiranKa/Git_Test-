# Git_Test-
This is a testing repository 
this is to test the commands of the Git and how to use the commands and to initialize the Git Hub repo 
and link the local resposoitory to with the remote respository. 
This is going to be the first test of the Odin project in the Windows Environment and it works fine thanks to the Git Bash console
also the console is available inside the Visual Studio Code and that is one of the advantage that I had while using OdinProjects
